# Learning-Linear-Regression-My-First-Machine-Learning-Project

This is my first Machine Learning project. In this project, I have learned how to use **Linear Regression** to predict values based on input data.

## 🔍 What I Learned

- What is Linear Regression and how it works  
- How to clean and prepare data using Pandas  
- How to split data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`  
- How to train the model using `LinearRegression()` from Scikit-Learn  
- How to evaluate model performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score (R-squared)

---

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn (sklearn)  

---

## 🚀 What I Did

- Built a simple Linear Regression model  
- Tested the model with sample data  
- Improved accuracy by checking errors  
- Pushed the complete project to GitHub

## 📁 Project Files

- `data.csv` — sample dataset  
- `linear_regression_model.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full code  
- `README.md` — This file

## 🙌 Future Plans

I will continue learning more Machine Learning algorithms like:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

Stay connected for more projects! 😊
